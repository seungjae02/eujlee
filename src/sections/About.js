                I am Eun Jung Lee. I’m a registered acupuncturist in <strong>Canada</strong> and the <strong>USA</strong> with 
                a focus on pain management. Formerly, I worked as a medical doctor 
                for 17 years in Seoul, South Korea. I also studied naturopathic medicine, 
                in addition to traditional Chinese medicine, in Canada. I can provide 
                beneficial health coaching for you additionally. I help people make 
                changes to their lifestyle and manage their pain using acupuncture, 
                cupping, and Tuina massage therapy. As a result, they no longer need to 
                rely on painkillers to sleep or function.

                acupuncture treatment. In addition, we will work together to create a 
                healthcare plan that allows you to do self-care to improve and maintain the 
                treatment’s effects. Research strongly supports that proactive healthcare 
                is the most effective; we can help shift your mindset in a way that results 
                in a more meaningful life and a better quality of living.
